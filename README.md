* Excellent overview once you do the primer above. It provides concise explanation on top of a working in-depth code tutorial. Also in JS.

  * Check out the working example in this repo copied over from [the jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/staltz/8jFJH/48/) by [Andre](http://jsfiddle.net/user/staltz/fiddles/) but for any environment/browser --> eg. open up `index.html` in Chrome.

* Once you have a handle on what "Reactive Programming" is, you can try your luck doing same logic in another language. This repo provides examples of Reactive Programming in Java.
